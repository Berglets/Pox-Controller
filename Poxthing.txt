A skeleton POX component

Rename this file to whatever you like, .e.g., mycomponent.py.  You can
then invoke it with "./pox.py mycomponent" if you leave it in the
ext/ directory.

Implement a launch() function (as shown below) which accepts commandline
arguments and starts off your component (e.g., by listening to events).
